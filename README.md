### This half-day workshop will be held in conjunction with IEEE [RO-MAN 2019](https://ro-man2019.org/) on 17th October 2019 (8.30am- 13.00pm), Room R3 "Inspire", Le Meridien, Windsor Place, New Delhi, India.

### Introduction
This inaugural workshop "Social robots and artificial agents for developing countries: Challenges and opportunities" will focus on the application of social robots and artificial agents to serve populations in developing countries. While social robots are making way into our lives these are primarily focused to serve populations in developed countries. There is a lack of human-robot interaction research in developing countries which is nearly half of the population on the planet. Social robots potentially can make a huge impact in the developing world where they are a distinct novelty and our understanding about how robots are perceived by these subjects is very limited. The focus of this workshop is on the following areas but not limited to: rural/urban development, education, health, gender issues, agriculture, environmental sustainability, social welfare, and sustainable development. We believe that these fields are those where social robots and artificial agents can have an impact on society in the developing world. This inaugural workshop is an initiative to bring researchers together to network, present and discuss the challenges and opportunities in developing social robotic applications that can serve people and communities in the developing world.

### Call for Papers:
We also encourage to submit previously published work if relevant to the workshop topic. Panels will discuss lessons learned as well as highlight what can be done in the near future. All accepted papers will be made available online on the workshop website and the authors will retain the copyright of their paper and to allow submitting the work as an improved full paper in other venues. We invite research work as short papers (4-page limit, plus additional pages for references) for oral and/or poster presentation. We also invite two-page abstracts/work in progress papers presenting specific solutions that address the challenges and opportunities for social robots to serve developing countries. The short papers would focus on ideally demonstrating a beneficial effect on populations in the developing world using social robots/agents to present the scientific to practical challenges that may be encountered when they are deployed. The two-page abstracts could present ideas that have not yet been applied in practice but can demonstrate real potential. The workshop provides a platform for developing these two-page abstracts into real projects and encourages collaborative discussion between academic, researchers and potential funders.

### Main Organiser:
### Dr. Amol Deshmukh
University Of Glasgow, United Kingdom

Bio: Dr Amol Deshmukh is a social robotics researcher working with computing science department at University of Glasgow. He is a Roboticist and built his first social robot during his Bachelor's in Electronics. He completed his Ph.D from Heriot-watt University in Edinburgh in human-robot interaction. Dr Deshmukh has worked on multiple European Union projects involving social robots in workplaces, child-robot interaction, public spaces, rural environments and has more than 40 publications. His current research involves social signal processing for social robots in public spaces for an EU-funded project MuMMER. He has also been involved conducting human-robot interaction studies with rural populations in India with a focus to learn the challenges to deploy robots in potentially useful scenarios to aid rural populations in developing countries “in the wild” and how people perceive the use of such technology [BBC News](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/technology-43814332/the-robot-helping-to-deliver-water-in-rural-india), [IEEE Spectrum](https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/robotics-hardware/robot-research-in-the-wild-water-transport-in-rural-india).

### Akshay Nagarajan, Amrita University, Kerala, India
Bio: Akshay Nagarajan is an assistant professor of robotics at Amrita University in India and the technical lead for maker education research at Ammachi labs, Amrita University. A large share of his work has been in devising methods for human motor skill development using haptic interfaces when he led the technology-enhanced learning and haptic simulators R&D team at Ammachi Labs since its inception in 2009. He area of expertise include measuring skills and designing robotic and haptic mechanisms that can facilitate human motor skill training in the context of vocational education, neurosurgery, and physical rehabilitation. He has worked with leading robotics labs at Stanford University and the University of Michigan, extending collaboration for Ammachi Labs with these centers in robotics and haptic technologies. He has also collaboratively conducted UI/UX and HRI studies with low-literacy users to inform the development of inclusive user interfaces and measure technology acceptance in these communities that has garnered widespread interest and received BBC coverage. Akshay is passionate about teaching children hands-on maker skills and design and has co-founded the 2nd Foundation Makerspace at Amrita University, conducts maker skills workshops in schools and remote villages across the country and has set up several makerspaces in schools serving rural and tribal communities. He was awarded the Fablearn Global Excellence Practioner Award by the Stanford Graduate School of Education in 2018 in recognition of his efforts in maker education research and for extending outreach, connecting communities and bringing equity to education in rural India.
