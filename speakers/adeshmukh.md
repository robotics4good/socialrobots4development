# Biography
Dr Amol Deshmukh is a social robotics researcher working with computing science department at University of Glasgow. He is a Roboticist and built his first social robot during his Bachelor's in Electronics. He completed his Ph.D from Heriot-watt University in Edinburgh in human-robot interaction. Dr Deshmukh has worked on multiple European Union projects involving social robots in workplaces, child-robot interaction, public spaces, rural environments and has more than 40 publications. His current research involves social signal processing for social robots in public spaces for an EU-funded project MuMMER. He has also been involved conducting human-robot interaction studies with rural populations in India with a focus to learn the challenges to deploy robots in potentially useful scenarios to aid rural populations in developing countries “in the wild” and how people perceive the use of such technology.
